# Mission to Mars

Adjust current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images by:

1. Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images
2. Store the scraped data on a Mongo database
3. Use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images
